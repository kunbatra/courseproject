#Readme file for the Data cleaning course project

* The code for the file read and its cleaning and analysis is in run_analysis.R
* The code assumes that the zip file of the raw data "getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip" exists in the same directory as the run_analysis.R
* The R code then checks for the existence of the raw data zip file: if file exists, then proceed, otherwise stop
* The R code then creates a subdirectory "mergeddata" for the target files. If the directory already exists, then it moves on to the next line of code.
